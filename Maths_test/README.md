# This file contains a maths ability test. Instructions will be shown when the code is run.
# Please run the code below in your command-line interface if this error message is displayed: ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'jupyter_ui_poll'
# pip install jupyter_ui_poll
# Please do not type numbers before being prompted, as this would exit the code.
# Due to the button and text box bug the code being submitted and the code used for data collection are different.
# The data collection code takes the time taken for each answer. However this time would increase if the debugged text box is used, as user would have to spend time to click onto the text box, introducing bias in the data.
# However, we did not end up using this data in the data analysis anyway.
# The code would run perfectly well, unless it is the first time the code is run on the device.
# In this particular case, text boxes would not be displayed and the code would not be able to progress. This can be fixed by restarting the kernel 2-3 times.
# I believe the code doesn't run into error messages because buttons aren't used until the very end, after all the text boxes are used.
# Therefore for the purposes of submitting unbugged code, I made an alternate version of code to be submitted.
# This code uses debugged text boxes and more buttons.
