# This file contains a maths ability test. Instructions will be shown when the code is run.
# Please run the code below in your command-line interface if this error message is displayed: ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'jupyter_ui_poll'
# pip install jupyter_ui_poll
# Please do not type numbers before being prompted, as this would exit the code.
# Also because of the bug involving buttons and input boxes, if you're running the code for the first time, you may have to restart the kernel if the code doesn't seem to progress. I cannot replace input boxes with the debugged ones as this would affect the time taken for each answer.
